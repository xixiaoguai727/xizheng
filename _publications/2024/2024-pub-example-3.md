  Delivering personalized support is essential in mental health care. Large language models (LLMs), with great customization potential, inspired us to explore how individuals customize chatbots to meet their emotional needs. Using a Research through Design approach, we developed ChatLab, a prototype that allows users to construct LLM-powered chatbots with additional interaction features such as voices and avatars.
In a week-long field study involving 22 participants, followed by interviews and design activities, we uncovered key practices in how participants created diverse chatbot personas for emotional reliance, confronting stressors, connecting to intellectual discourse, and reflecting mirrored selves, etc. Participants actively enriched the personas they constructed, shaping the dynamics between themselves and the chatbot to foster open and honest conversations. During the design activities, participants suggested additional customizable features, such as integrating online activities and adjustable memory settings. Based on these findings, we discuss opportunities for enhancing personalized emotional support through emerging technologies.
